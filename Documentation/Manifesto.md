# A Fair and Free Internet
This is an independent project inspired by Tim Berners-Lee, Nigel Shadbolt and all those who envision an internet where the user has control over their data.
Since 2016, W3C has been working on [Solid](https://solidproject.org/), a project that allows people to control their own data and choose the apps that have access to it.
BOYD is guided by the same principals of handing control back to the user and is an experiment in data sovereignty.
Solid, although a fantastic proof-of-concept, may be difficult to understand for the layman.
BOYD seeks to be easy to write applications for and easy to use by the user.

# A Standardised File Structure
BOYD seeks to be easy to use by offering an easy-to-access file structure. Common types of data that may be shared on the internet include: Documents, Images, Videos and Text.
A BOYD server will provide directories for each of these that will be accessible through TCP request from validated requesters.
In an ideal world, BOYD servers will be able to be set up by users on devices such as Raspberry Pis, or set up through online providers.

# A Ledger
Domain Names are not free. Should BOYD require users to buy their own domains, or publicly post their server's IPs, rather than use a domain name, it would defeat the point of "A Fair and Free Internet".
A fully functioning BOYD would be paired with a Ledger, a server that acts as a redirect to people's own personally hosted BOYD servers, or BOYD servers hosted elsewhere.
The BOYD ledger would provide users with subdomains that redirect to personal BOYD servers.

<em>BOYD is not intended for commercial use.</em>
